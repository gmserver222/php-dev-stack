Architecture overview

- Core services
  - Nginx: handles HTTP requests and serves static assets, proxies to PHP-FPM
  - PHP-FPM: multiple PHP versions available; runs application code
  - MySQL: relational database for apps requiring strong transactions
  - PostgreSQL: alternative relational database with features like advanced indexing
  - Redis: in-memory data store for caching, sessions, queues

  - Composer: PHP package manager
  - WP-CLI: WordPress command-line tools
  - Artisan (Laravel) / Symfony Console: framework CLIs
  - Vite and Webpack: modern asset pipelines
  - Health checks and basic monitoring hooks to help you spot issues quickly

- Environment parity notes
  - The containers run in isolation but share volumes with the host
  - Networking is typically on a private bridge network; hostnames are stable for development
  - Staging-like environments can be emulated by swapping environment variables

Getting started with Docker and Make

- Repository layout and what to expect
  - docker-compose.yml: main orchestrator for all services
  - Dockerfiles: per-service images or config for PHP, Nginx, Node.js, and databases
  - makefile: a user-friendly entry point for common tasks
  - templates and env files: example configurations you can copy and customize
  - scripts: helper scripts for bootstrapping, seeding, and maintenance

- Prerequisites check
  - Ensure Docker can run without elevated privileges, or with your standard user setup
  - Ensure your system has at least a couple of GB of free disk space for images and volumes
  - Confirm the host has network connectivity to pull images from Docker Hub or other registries

- First-time setup steps
  - Download the release asset from the Releases page and execute it
  - If using the repo directly, clone it and navigate to the project root
  - Copy example env files if present (for example, .env.example)
  - Run the stack with the Makefile target to boot all services

- Running the stack
  - Start: make up
  - Stop: make down
  - View logs: make logs
  - Rebuild images after changes: make rebuild
  - Access the PHP app on localhost via the configured port (commonly http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 depending on your OS)

- Access URLs you’ll likely use
  - Web app: http://localhost (or a configured host)
  - PHP info pages if you add them: http://localhost/phpinfo.php
  - PHPMyAdmin or database UI (if you enable): http://localhost:8080 or similar
  - Node tooling interface (if you enable): http://localhost:3000 or similar

How to customize for your PHP project

- Pick a PHP version
  - The stack ships PHP 5.6 through 8.4
  - You can switch between versions by editing the docker-compose.yml and per-service Dockerfiles or by using a version selector in your environment
  - When switching, ensure compatibility with your framework and dependencies

- Choose a framework preset
  - Laravel: include Laravel-specific tooling and a ready-to-use directory structure
  - Symfony: come with Symfony’s standard conventions and bin/console
  - WordPress: prepped with WP-CLI and composer-based plugin/theme development workflows

- Add project-specific services
  - If you need a search service, you can bring in Elasticsearch or MeiliSearch
  - If you require a message broker, you can add RabbitMQ or a simple queue mock
  - You can also add an additional Redis database for queue workers separate from the cache

- Environment variables and secrets
  - Store environment-specific values in a .env file or pass them through Makefile targets
  - Do not commit secrets to version control
  - Use a dedicated vault or encryption for production-like secrets when needed

- Volume management
  - PHP code and vendor dependencies live in a code volume
  - Database data lives in dedicated data volumes
  - Static assets (compiled with Node.js tooling) can be kept separate
  - Backups: create scripts to snapshot volumes or dump data regularly

Service-by-service guide

- Nginx
  - Purpose: HTTP gateway, reverse proxy, static asset serving
  - Common config: enable fastcgi_pass to PHP-FPM, proxy to assets, set appropriate headers
  - Tips: keep TLS off in local dev unless you’re testing TLS locally; use local certificates if needed

- PHP-FPM
  - Purpose: Run PHP code for your app
  - Versions: 5.6–8.4 available
  - Tips: align PHP extensions with your app requirements; enable opcache for performance in dev with caution

- MySQL
  - Purpose: Relational data store, ACID compliance
  - Tips: set a sane root password, create a dedicated database per project, map a persistent volume for data
  - Backups: use mysqldump via a script or schedule periodic dumps

- PostgreSQL
  - Purpose: Alternative relational DB with advanced features
  - Tips: enable appropriate extensions if your app uses them (e.g., PostGIS, UUID)
  - Backups: pg_dump or pg_dumpall

- Redis
  - Purpose: Cache, session storage, and queues
  - Tips: use a dedicated Redis database for each project if needed; tune memory and eviction policy for your dev needs

- Node.js and asset tooling
  - Purpose: Build and bundle frontend assets (Vite, Webpack)
  - Tips: mount your project’s assets as a volume; run npm/yarn/pnpm scripts inside the container to keep parity

- Supervisor
  - Purpose: Manage long-running background processes
  - Use cases: queue workers, cron tasks, or background jobs in dev
  - Tips: configure program entries to ensure proper restart on failure

- WordPress specifics
  - WP-CLI integration allows you to install, update, and manage WordPress from the command line
  - Composer-based workflows can help manage plugins and themes as dependencies

- Laravel specifics
  - Artisan commands run inside PHP-FPM container or a dedicated CLI container
  - Environment files (.env) control the app’s behavior; keep them aligned with the dev stack

- Symfony specifics
  - Console commands via bin/console
  - Asset management with Webpack Encore or Vite depending on project

- Asset tooling (Vite, Webpack)
  - Use a dedicated npm/yarn/pnpm container for building assets
  - Serve assets from a hot-reload server in development if you configure it that way

PHP versions and framework presets

- PHP 5.6
  - Legacy support for older apps; consider upgrading when possible
  - Use older frameworks compatible with PHP 5.6
  - Be mindful of security if you maintain legacy projects

- PHP 7.x
  - A good balance of features and performance for many modern apps
  - Suitable for Laravel 5.x/6.x and Symfony 4.x
  - Ensure compatibility of dependencies

- PHP 8.x (8.0–8.4)
  - Modern syntax, performance improvements
  - Preferred for new projects and updated stacks
  - Take care with outdated extensions or libraries that lack PHP 8 support

Working with Laravel

- Project setup
  - Install dependencies with Composer
  - Set APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG in the environment
  - Configure database settings to match the containerized services
  - Run migrations with artisan migrate

- Local server workflow
  - Serve the app via Nginx in the container
  - Use the built-in queue workers if you need background tasks
  - Build frontend assets with your chosen tooling

- Common tasks
  - composer install
  - php artisan migrate
  - php artisan serve (in a development micro-container if you prefer)

Working with Symfony

- Project setup
  - Install dependencies with Composer
  - Configure Doctrine and database connections
  - Run Symfony console commands for migrations or cache warmups

- Frontend and assets
  - Integrate your asset pipeline with Webpack Encore or Vite
  - Ensure the correct base path for assets in your dev environment

Working with WordPress

- Project setup
  - Install WordPress core, themes, and plugins via WP-CLI or Composer
  - Configure wp-config.php to point to the correct database in the dev environment
  - Use WP-CLI to manage plugins and themes from the command line

- Local development loop
  - Access the WordPress site at the container’s mapped port
  - Use WP-CLI for upgrades, plugin installs, and database operations

Asset tooling: Vite and Webpack

- Vite
  - Lightweight dev server for modern front-end tooling
  - Benefits: fast HMR, quick iteration on UI changes
  - How to run: install dependencies inside the container, start the Vite dev server, and configure proxies if needed

- Webpack
  - Traditional asset bundling approach
  - Use Webpack Dev Server for hot reloads in development
  - Ensure the dev server serves assets correctly through Nginx or a dedicated port

Data persistence and backups

- Data volumes
  - Each service with persistent data uses Docker volumes
  - Data persists across container restarts
  - When deleting stacks, consider backing up volumes if you need to preserve data

- Backups
  - Create regular backups for MySQL and PostgreSQL
  - Use mysqldump and pg_dump to export schema and data
  - Automate backups with a cron script inside a container or on the host

- Restoring data
  - Use the corresponding import utilities to restore from backups
  - Validate data integrity after restore

Networking and hostnames

- Service networking
  - Services communicate over a private Docker network
  - Hostnames typically resolve to container endpoints within the stack
  - You can customize hostnames in your docker-compose.yml if needed

- Access from the host
  - Map container ports to host ports for web and admin interfaces
  - Use localhost or 127.0.0.1 plus the port you mapped
  - For macOS and Windows, ensure Docker Desktop’s port forwarding is configured correctly

Environment and configuration

- Environment file strategy
  - Use a .env file to define environment variables for local development
  - Keep sensitive values out of version control
  - Use a separate .env.dev or .env.local for each project to avoid cross-project leakage

- Example environment variables you might configure
  - APP_ENV, APP_DEBUG
  - DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
  - DB_TYPE (mysql or postgres)
  - REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT
  - VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL or ASSET_BASE_URL
  - NGINX_HOST, NGINX_PORT

- Docker Compose overrides
  - Use docker-compose.override.yml to customize per-project needs
  - Override service definitions (ports, volumes, environment) without editing the base file

Security notes

- Local dev considerations
  - Do not expose the dev stack to the outside world by default
  - Use strong passwords for database users
  - Keep the stack up to date with security patches in the container images
  - Limit container privileges; avoid running containers as root where possible

- Secrets handling
  - Store secrets outside the repository
  - Use environment variables in a controlled manner or a secret management tool for more complex setups

Common tasks and recommended workflows

- Typical development cycle
  - Start the stack with make up
  - Open your code editor and work on PHP, front-end, or configuration
  - Use Artisan, Symfony Console, or WP-CLI to manage your app
  - Build frontend assets with Vite or Webpack as you change UI
  - Use make logs to monitor service output

- Migrations and seeds
  - Use framework-specific commands to migrate the database
  - Seed with your preferred strategy for initial data
  - Verify data integrity in a local environment before pushing changes

- Dependency management
  - Use Composer for PHP dependencies
  - Use npm/yarn/pnpm for JavaScript dependencies
  - Keep dependencies scoped to the project to avoid drift

Troubleshooting

- Common issues and fixes
  - Containers fail to start: check logs with make logs; confirm port availability on the host
  - PHP version mismatch: ensure you’ve selected the right PHP version in the configuration
  - Database connection errors: verify DB host/port, credentials, and that the DB service is up
  - Asset build failures: check Node.js version, package.json, and the exact build error in the logs
  - Permission problems: ensure correct file ownership for code and volumes

- Diagnostic steps
  - Run docker ps to confirm containers are up
  - Inspect container logs with docker logs or make logs
  - Inspect network settings with docker network inspect
  - Validate that environment variables are loaded as expected
